## **Project: Spaceship Titanic Rescue**

Welcome to the "Spaceship Titanic Rescue" project! In this project, we use data analysis and machine learning skills to help solve a cosmic mystery. In the year 2912, a catastrophe occurred: the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly, and nearly half of the passengers were transported to a parallel dimension. Our task is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using data recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.
